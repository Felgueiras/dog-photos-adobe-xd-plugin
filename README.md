# Dog Photos Adobe XD plugin

I've followed [this tutorial](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/tutorials/quick-start-react/) to setup the project.
The dog breeds and respective images come from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).
This was just a simple test on how to develop plugins for Adobe XD using React.

## How To

Load the plugin to the plugins directory, select an artboard and click on the plugin from the plugins list. Then, select the dog breed on the modal, if you're not happy with the image you can pick another one (for the same breed), and then click on the button to add the photo to the artboard.
